  * Authors Terry Martin and Cynthia Prentice-Craver combine passion for and experience teaching human anatomy and physiology with a commitment to developing curricula that stimulates student curiosity and enthusiasm, which results in a laboratory manual with an innovative, hands-on approach that benefits students. The Laboratory Manual for Human Anatomy & Physiology includes a main version, a cat version, and a fetal pig version. Each of these includes sixty-three laboratory exercises, three supplemental labs found online, and six cat, or fetal pig, dissection labs in corresponding versions. All versions are written to work well with any anatomy and physiology text.
